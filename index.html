    <h1> 
      Ocean the cat
    </h1>
    <p> Hello, my name is Ocean. I am a nine years old, norwegian forest cat and I am callico colored. I love to lounge, eat and hunt everything
        that moves. In this blog I'd like to give you a look into my everyday life. I hope you enjoy reading my blog!
        Let's start with my favorite activities: 
    </p>
    <ol start="1">
      <li> Begging for treats like my life depends on it </li>
      <li> Biting people for no reason </li>
      <li> Chasing small animals </li>
      <li> Sleeping for 20 hours</li>
    </ol>
  
    <h2> What is so special about me? </h3>
    <p> My mother, Milia, hasn't been taking care of me since I was a baby. About a year ago I decided to sneak into her house and
        nap on the chair in the kitchen. After that I thought that it would be a good idea, to just stay at her place and that has worked
        out fine, because she has enough patience to keep up with all my demands.
